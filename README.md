# Barcode-Web-Api

The project aims to replicate a pick-by-light system, which is widely used in companies in their warehouse areas. For this purpose, we utilize Raspberry Pi and Python to carry out this process. After the reading, the data is sent to the website https://evertonfranca.com.br/smtyts/, where we have built an API to display and delete the data coming from the Raspberry Pi's reading.

We also used the UPC Database API, as it catalogs the barcode codes: https://www.upcdatabase.com/
